ChatBot AI using ChatterBot with Huggingface RAG technology.<br>

In Order to Run the Chatbot there are certain pre-requisites and due to the limited facilities provided by the Chatterbot model.<br>

Python Version should be equal to or less than 3.8 in order for the chatterbot model to work and a virtual environment is advisable so that the global python package and the package required for this doesnt interrupt the process.<br>

For the Huggingface transformers library to work we need pyaml version 4.0 which is not compatible with chatterbot AI model, so creating a virtual environment for the chatterbot is advisable.<br>

This is designed for a legal chatbot and its dataset should contain all the questions and answers specified in the CSV file, The Indian Constitution rules and laws should be integrated and it is a work in progress.<br>

Any help is really appreciated.<br>
